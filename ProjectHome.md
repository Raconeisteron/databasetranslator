DBExporter is a tool to export  definitions and data from a database to another one.

It reads your source database and create a SQL script that contains all the instructions for  create again the same database, as closely as possible in the SQL syntax of the chosen format.

The differences between the databases, such data types, trigger instead of auto\_increment or lack of some instructions, impose to create a targeted procedure for each combination.

At moment are supported import from /to :Access, Excel, PostgreSQL, Firebird, MySQL and MS SQL Server.

The software is open source developed  in Visual Basic Express 2010.

The script includes also Drop instructions and Foreign keys. It impose that the user is aware of SQL, because with some databases, the import must be done step by step.

You are all welcome to help the development.

I propose you two downloads, the .exe version. There is no need to install something, just extract elsewhere in your Computer and click on the Icon.

Or the source Files to compile with Visual Basic 2010.
